## Introduction

Python is developed by Guido van Rossum. Guido van Rossum started implementing Python in 1989. Python is a very simple programming language so even if you are new to programming, you can learn python without facing any issues.

## Applications of Python

You may be wondering what all are the applications of Python. There are so many applications of Python, here are some of the them.

- **Web Development** - Web framework like Django and Flask are based on Python. They help you write server side code which helps you manage database, write backend programming logic, mapping urls etc. **[Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/)**

- **Machine learning** - ML is field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.Pyton is one of the best choice for ML and AI.

- **Data Anaysis** - Data analysis and data visualisation in form of charts can also be developed using Python. Matplotlib & seaborn are basic library for graphs in Python.

- **Game Development** - Python is also used in the development of interactive games. There are libraries such as PySoy which is a 3D game engine supporting Python 3, PyGame which provides functionality and a library for game development. Games such as Civilization-IV, Disneyâ€™s Toontown Online, Vega Strike etc. have been built using Python.

- **Desktop Application** - Python can be used to program desktop applications. It provides the Tkinter library that can be used to develop user interfaces. There are some other useful toolkits such as the wxWidgets, Kivy, PYQT that can be used to create applications on several platforms.

- **Scripting Tools** - Python can be used to pull a large amount of data from websites which can then be helpful in various real-world processes such as price comparison, job listings, research and development and much more.
